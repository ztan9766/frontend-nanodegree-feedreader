# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# Introduction

Open index.html file in browser(chrome suggested), all tests will be run automatically.

# Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
